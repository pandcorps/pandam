TODO

ActionEvent, ActionEndEvent need triggering Panput, Panteraction.register/get

Register for only keys instead of all inputs?

Add configuration option for frame rate and enforce it

Some layers are drawn but not updated
(if the player brings up a menu that covers part of the screen, we might want to pause the base layer)
Some layers are not even drawn
(no need to draw base layer if a menu covers the whole screen)
Some layers are drawn without filling/checking depth buffer
(a background layer without overlapping tiles doesn't need to compare depths among itself,
and a foreground layer shouldn't need to clear the background's depth)
If a layer is not updated, it shouldn't receive events,
but event handlers don't need to be Panctors or be tied to layers; how to resolve?
